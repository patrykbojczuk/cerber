 * `mergeConcurrentEdits` exists to stop a chat turn making.

 * work surviving one. What it does *not* own are the decisions:
 *
 *   - **a send** stands, and takes the status with it. Without this a run
 *     finishing after a send wrote `sent: null` back over the record, and the
 *     "already sent" guard would then wave a second submission through.
 *   - **a settle** stands too: `reviewed` and `skipped` are decisions about the
 *     PR, not facts about the code, so a run completing does not reopen one.
 *     The fresh draft still lands underneath, which is what the row shows if
 *     the user changes their mind.
 *   - **the conversation** is the user's writing, snapshot and all.
