/**
 * Applying a chat turn's edits to the review it is about.
 *
 * A chat turn writes the draft directly — the user asked for the change, and
 * asking again with an "accept" button would be friction wearing safety's coat.
 * What it must NOT do is quietly overwrite the user's own words: a comment the
 * user wrote or rewrote is the one thing in the artifact the AI did not author,
 * and a re-review already carries it across rather than discarding it. A
 * chat turn is the second way to lose that work, and this is where it doesn't.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no clock beyond what the caller passes in.
