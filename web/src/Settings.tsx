      <h1>Inbox</h1>
      <p>
        By default cerber keeps the queue itself: it polls GitHub for PRs awaiting your review and
        drafts a review for each, so they're ready when you open the cockpit. Nothing is ever sent
        without you. Changes apply on the next poll — no restart.

      <h1>Notifications</h1>
      <p>
        When a PR is worth coming back for, cerber says so: one desktop notification per poll. With
        auto-review on that moment is the draft landing, not the PR arriving — a tap that leads to
        "no run yet" costs you the walk back and gives you nothing — and the notification names
        what the review found. A PR nobody is drafting (auto-review off, or a run that failed) is
        announced as it lands, since that is all the news there will be — and if a retry then
        drafts it after all, that is new news and you are told. Several at once fold into one
        notification, and a PR whose draft has been announced never arrives twice, however its
        next re-review ends.
      </p>
      <label className="inbox-toggle">
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={config.daemon.notify}

        tell this machine when a review is ready for you (no cockpit tab required)
      </label>
      <p className="muted">
        This is the one that works while you're somewhere else: it rides the poll, so it needs
        nothing open but <code>serve</code> itself. It hands the notification to
        whatever this machine already has — Notification Centre on macOS,{" "}
        <code>notify-send</code> on Linux — and stays quiet where there is neither. On macOS it{" "}
        <strong>opens that review when you click it</strong>, through a small app cerber builds
        for the job (the first one asks you to allow notifications from "Cerber"); a{" "}

            prompt, not cerber's — a browser that has blocked cerber has to be un-blocked from the
            padlock next to the address bar. Nothing is announced while you're looking straight at
            the cockpit.

      <h1>Trusted PRs</h1>

      <p>
        Every review reads the PR's code. A <strong>trusted</strong> review may also run it — the
        test that covers the change, a typecheck, <code>git log</code> — so it can report what
        happened instead of guessing. That means executing code from the PR on this machine, the
        same as checking the branch out and running the tests yourself.
      </p>
      <p className="muted">
        Trust the people, not the code: nothing about a PR can earn it. Rules live in{" "}
        <code>{config.path}</code>.
      </p>
      <p className="muted">
        Only people can be trusted — there is no way to trust a repository. Anyone can open a PR
        against a repo you own, so trusting the repo would trust them too. Membership is checked
        against GitHub when the review runs, and a check that fails counts as "not a member".

        A trusted review is handed no GitHub credentials — no token, no <code>gh</code> login, no
        git or ssh identity — so a push fails to authenticate rather than being merely discouraged.
        It is not a sandbox though: it has <code>Bash</code> and this machine, so trust people you
        would let run their branch here anyway.
        The daemon reviews unattended, so with rules set it runs matching PRs' code with nobody
        watching — start it with <code>--no-trust</code> to prevent that.
